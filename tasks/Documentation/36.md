# Create minimalist, eye-catching README.md

Create a README that sparks curiosity rather than explaining everything. Keep it minimal and compelling since we have comprehensive documentation.

- [ ] Design a visually striking header/tagline
- [ ] Show a quick, powerful example (not a tutorial)
- [ ] Add documentation badge linking to the site
- [ ] Include minimal but essential badges (version, license, etc.)
- [ ] Keep "getting started" to 2-3 commands max
- [ ] Tease key features without explaining them in detail
- [ ] Strong call-to-action to read the full documentation
- [ ] Validation: Does it make you curious to learn more?
