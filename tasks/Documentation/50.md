# Transform README.md into project showcase

- [ ] Compelling tagline/headline that captures project essence
- [ ] Brief value proposition (1-2 sentences on why Quadro is special)
- [ ] Key differentiators (markdown-first, git-friendly, MCP integration)
- [ ] Minimal essential badges (PyPI version, CI status, license)
- [ ] Quick installation snippet (one-liner)
- [ ] Single compelling usage example (shows elegance/simplicity)
- [ ] Prominent link to documentation site
- [ ] Keep it short, visual, and impactful - this is our storefront
- [ ] Everything else goes to docs site
- [ ] Validation: Does it make you want to try it?
