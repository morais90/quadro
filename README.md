Quadro connects spec-driven development with AI assistants. Write your requirements as tasks. Your AI reads them and helps you implement. The specs stay with your code, version controlled and always in sync.

**What makes it different:**

- **Markdown files** — Tasks are just files in your repo. Edit them, commit them, grep through them.
- **MCP integration** — Your AI assistant can read your tasks and help you implement them.
- **Terminal-native** — Fast commands. No browser tabs. Everything runs locally.
- **Git-friendly** — Version control your tasks alongside your code. No external services.

Your specs become your task board. Your AI reads your task board. You build together.
