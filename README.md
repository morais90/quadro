**The problem:**

You're building with an AI assistant. You explain what you want in chat. Next session,
your AI forgot. You explain again. Or you just start coding without planning and fix
issues as they come up.

<br>

**What Quadro is:**

A task manager that stores tasks as markdown files in your repo. Your AI can read them
through MCP.

You write down what you want to build. Your AI sees it. No copy-paste between sessions.
When you plan first, you catch problems early. Your AI makes better suggestions because
it knows what you're trying to do.

<br>

**This might work for you if:**

- You code with an AI assistant
- You want to plan your work instead of figuring it out while coding
- You need your AI to remember what you're building across sessions
- You prefer terminal tools and keeping everything in git
